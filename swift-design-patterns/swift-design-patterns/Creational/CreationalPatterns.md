#  Creational Patterns

The creational patterns are designed to deal with the object creation mechanism in software designing. A system using these patterns becomes independent of how objects are created, which means it is independent of how concrete classes are instantiated.

These patterns encapsulate the use of concrete classes and favor the use of interfaces in the relationship between objects, allowing to have better abstraction of the global system conception.
