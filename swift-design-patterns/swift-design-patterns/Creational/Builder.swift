//The main purpose of the builder pattern is to abstract the building of complex objects from its actual construction.
//Having the same construction process can create different representations of the product. This pattern can be used when:
//A client needs to construct complex objects without having to know its implementation
//A client needs to construct complex objects that need to have several implementations or representations
