//“The flyweight pattern
//
//This pattern can be used when the system needs to deal with a large number of similar objects. Instead of creating
//each element one by one, this pattern permits you to reuse an object that shares the same data.
//
//Roles
//
//The flyweight pattern is used to reduce the memory and resource usage of complex models that contain many
//hundreds and thousands of similar objects by reducing the number of objects created. It tries to reuse similar
//existing objects or creates a new one when no match is found.
//
//Use when:
//
//You need to manipulate a lot of small similar objects
//The cost (the memory/execution time) of this manipulation is high”
